# Detailed Overall Style Specification: Fish Game

## 1. Introduction
This document provides a detailed specification for the overall visual style of Fish Game. It outlines the design decisions, implementation details, and final requirements for creating a vibrant and realistic 3D underwater environment.

## 2. Core Visual Style

### 2.1. General Aesthetic
*   **Description:** The game will have a vibrant and realistic 3D style, aiming to capture the beauty and diversity of the Great Barrier Reef.
*   **Design Decisions:**
    *   **Realism:** The environment will be designed to resemble the real Great Barrier Reef, with accurate coral formations, fish species, and lighting.
    *   **Vibrancy:** The color palette will be bright and saturated to create a visually appealing and engaging experience.
    *   **Depth:** The underwater environment will be designed to convey a sense of depth and immersion.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **3D Modeling:** High-quality 3D models will be used for all environment elements, fish, and objects.
    *   **Texturing:** High-resolution textures will be used to create a realistic look.
    *   **Lighting:** Dynamic lighting will be used to simulate underwater conditions, with light rays filtering through the water and creating caustics on the seabed.
    *   **Post-Processing:** Post-processing effects will be used to enhance the visual quality of the game, such as bloom, color correction, and depth of field.
*   **Final Requirements:**
    *   The game should have a realistic and visually appealing 3D style.
    *   The environment should be vibrant and colorful.
    *   The underwater environment should convey a sense of depth and immersion.
    *   The game should be optimized for performance.

### 2.2. Lighting and Atmosphere
*   **Description:** The underwater environment will be well-lit, with darker areas in caves and deep parts to add suspense.
*   **Design Decisions:**
    *   **Dynamic Lighting:** Dynamic lighting will be used to simulate the movement of the sun and the refraction of light through water.
    *   **Caustics:** Caustics will be used to create realistic light patterns on the seabed.
    *   **Dark Areas:** Caves and deep parts of the reef will be darker to add suspense and encourage exploration.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **Directional Light:** A directional light will be used to simulate sunlight.
    *   **Point Lights:** Point lights will be used to create local lighting effects.
    *   **Shaders:** Shaders will be used to create caustics and other lighting effects.
    *   **Ambient Occlusion:** Ambient occlusion will be used to add depth to the scene.
*   **Final Requirements:**
    *   The lighting should simulate underwater conditions.
    *   Caustics should be used to create realistic light patterns on the seabed.
    *   Caves and deep areas should be darker to add suspense.
    *   The lighting should be optimized for performance.

### 2.3. Visual Effects
*   **Description:** Visual effects will be used to enhance the underwater feel and create a more immersive experience.
*   **Design Decisions:**
    *   **Water Distortion:** A slight distortion effect will be used to simulate the refractive properties of water.
    *   **Particle Effects:** Particle effects will be used to create bubbles and other underwater effects.
    *   **Motion Blur:** Motion blur will be used to enhance the sense of movement.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **Shaders:** Shaders will be used to create the water distortion effect.
    *   **Particle Systems:** Particle systems will be used to create bubbles and other effects.
    *   **Post-Processing:** Post-processing effects will be used to create motion blur.
*   **Final Requirements:**
    *   The water should have a slight distortion effect.
    *   Particle effects should be used to create bubbles and other underwater effects.
    *   Motion blur should be used to enhance the sense of movement.
    *   The visual effects should be optimized for performance.

## 3. Libraries and Tools
*   **3D Game Engine:** Three.js
*   **3D Modeling Software:** Blender
*   **Text Editor:** VSCode
*   **Version Control:** Git

## 4. Testing
*   **Visual Inspection:** The visual style should be inspected to ensure it meets the design requirements.
*   **Performance Testing:** The game should be tested on different browsers and devices to ensure it runs smoothly.
