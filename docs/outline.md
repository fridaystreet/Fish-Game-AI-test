# Game Outline: Fish Game

## Core Concept
The player controls a fish in a 3D underwater environment, exploring the Great Barrier Reef. The primary goals are to collect coins, gain experience points (XP), avoid predators, and discover hidden treasures. The game will feature a shop where players can use their XP to purchase upgrades, new skins, and different fish species.

## Gameplay Loop

2.  **Collection:** Coins are collected by swimming through them, and treasure chests are opened using an interact button.
3.  **Progression:** XP is gained by collecting coins and opening treasure chests. This XP is used in the shop to purchase upgrades.
4.  **Challenges:** Players must avoid predators and other dangers specific to their chosen fish species.
5.  **Shop:** Players can access a shop screen outside of the main gameplay to spend XP on upgrades, skins, and new fish species.
