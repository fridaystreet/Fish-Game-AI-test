# Detailed Environment Visual Specification: Fish Game

## 1. Introduction
This document provides a detailed specification for the visual design of the game environment in Fish Game. It outlines the design decisions, implementation details, and final requirements for creating a realistic and engaging 3D underwater world.

## 2. Core Environment Visuals

### 2.1. Reef Structure
*   **Description:** The reef will be composed of various coral formations, rocks, and caves, creating a diverse and interesting environment.
*   **Design Decisions:**
    *   **Variety:** The reef will feature a variety of coral types, including branching coral, brain coral, and soft coral.
    *   **Realism:** The coral formations will be based on real-world examples, with accurate shapes and textures.
    *   **Depth:** The reef will be designed to create a sense of depth, with varying heights and levels.
    *   **Navigation:** The reef will be designed to encourage exploration and discovery, with hidden paths and areas.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **3D Modeling:** Blender will be used to create the 3D models for the coral, rocks, and caves.
    *   **Texturing:** High-resolution textures will be used to create a realistic look.
    *   **Placement:** The coral, rocks, and caves will be placed strategically throughout the environment to create a visually appealing and navigable space.
*   **Final Requirements:**
    *   The reef should be composed of a variety of coral types, rocks, and caves.
    *   The coral formations should be realistic and visually appealing.
    *   The reef should create a sense of depth and encourage exploration.
    *   The environment should be optimized for performance.

### 2.2. Lighting
*   **Description:** The lighting will simulate underwater conditions, with light rays filtering through the water and creating caustics on the seabed.
*   **Design Decisions:**
    *   **Sunlight:** A directional light will be used to simulate sunlight filtering through the water.
    *   **Caustics:** Caustics will be used to create realistic light patterns on the seabed.
    *   **Local Lighting:** Point lights will be used to create local lighting effects, such as light reflecting off coral and rocks.
    *   **Dark Areas:** Caves and deep areas will be darker to add suspense and encourage exploration.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **Directional Light:** A directional light will be used to simulate sunlight.
    *   **Point Lights:** Point lights will be used to create local lighting effects.
    *   **Shaders:** Shaders will be used to create caustics and other lighting effects.
    *   **Ambient Occlusion:** Ambient occlusion will be used to add depth to the scene.
*   **Final Requirements:**
    *   The lighting should simulate underwater conditions.
    *   Caustics should be used to create realistic light patterns on the seabed.
    *   Local lighting should be used to highlight specific areas of the environment.
    *   Caves and deep areas should be darker to add suspense.
    *   The lighting should be optimized for performance.

### 2.3. Water Effects
*   **Description:** The water will have a slight distortion effect to simulate the refractive properties of water.
*   **Design Decisions:**
    *   **Refraction:** A slight distortion effect will be used to simulate the refraction of light through water.
    *   **Clarity:** The water will be clear enough to see the environment, but with a slight haze to simulate the underwater atmosphere.
    *   **Movement:** The water will have a subtle movement effect to simulate currents.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **Shaders:** Shaders will be used to create the water distortion effect.
    *   **Transparency:** The water will be slightly transparent to allow the environment to be seen.
    *   **Animation:** A subtle animation will be used to simulate water movement.
*   **Final Requirements:**
    *   The water should have a slight distortion effect.
    *   The water should be clear enough to see the environment.
    *   The water should have a subtle movement effect.
    *   The water effects should be optimized for performance.

### 2.4. Background
*   **Description:** The background will feature a gradient of blue, fading into darker shades at the bottom, to create a sense of depth.
*   **Design Decisions:**
    *   **Gradient:** A gradient of blue will be used to create a sense of depth.
    *   **Darker Shades:** The background will fade into darker shades at the bottom to simulate the deep ocean.
    *   **Subtlety:** The background will be subtle and not distracting from the main environment.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **CSS:** The background gradient will be defined in the CSS file for the game.
    *   **Shaders:** Shaders can be used to create a more complex background.
*   **Final Requirements:**
    *   The background should feature a gradient of blue.
    *   The background should fade into darker shades at the bottom.
    *   The background should be subtle and not distracting from the main environment.
    *   The background should be optimized for performance.

## 3. Libraries and Tools
*   **3D Game Engine:** Three.js
*   **3D Modeling Software:** Blender
*   **Text Editor:** VSCode
*   **Version Control:** Git

## 4. Testing
*   **Visual Inspection:** The environment should be inspected to ensure it meets the design requirements.
*   **Performance Testing:** The game should be tested on different browsers and devices to ensure it runs smoothly.
