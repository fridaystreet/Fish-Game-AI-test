# Detailed Fish Design Specification: Fish Game

## 1. Introduction
This document provides a detailed specification for the visual design of the fish in Fish Game. It outlines the design decisions, implementation details, and final requirements for creating a variety of visually appealing and unique fish species.

## 2. Core Fish Design

### 2.1. Variety
*   **Description:** Different fish species will have unique shapes, colors, and fin designs, reflecting the diversity of the Great Barrier Reef.
*   **Design Decisions:**
    *   **Species Representation:** The fish species will be based on real-world examples, such as clownfish, angelfish, and lionfish.
    *   **Unique Shapes:** Each fish species will have a unique body shape, fin design, and overall silhouette.
    *   **Coloration:** Each fish species will have a unique color palette, reflecting its natural coloration.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **3D Modeling:** Blender will be used to create the 3D models for the different fish species.
    *   **Texturing:** High-resolution textures will be used to create a realistic look.
    *   **Animation:** Skeletal animation or morph targets will be used to animate the fish.
*   **Final Requirements:**
    *   The fish species should be based on real-world examples.
    *   Each fish species should have a unique shape, color, and fin design.
    *   The fish should be visually appealing and recognizable.
    *   The fish models should be optimized for performance.

### 2.2. Animation
*   **Description:** Fish will have smooth swimming animations, with variations for speed boost and attack.
*   **Design Decisions:**
    *   **Swimming Animation:** The swimming animation will be smooth and realistic, with subtle movements of the fins and body.
    *   **Speed Boost Animation:** The speed boost animation will be more exaggerated, with faster fin movements and a more streamlined body position.
    *   **Attack Animation:** The attack animation will be unique to each fish species, with a visual effect to indicate the attack.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **Skeletal Animation:** Skeletal animation will be used to animate the fish.
    *   **Morph Targets:** Morph targets can be used to create more complex animations.
    *   **Animation Blending:** Animation blending will be used to create smooth transitions between different animations.
*   **Final Requirements:**
    *   The swimming animation should be smooth and realistic.
    *   The speed boost animation should be more exaggerated.
    *   The attack animation should be unique to each fish species.
    *   The animations should be optimized for performance.

### 2.3. Skins
*   **Description:** Skins will be cosmetic changes to the fish's appearance, such as different colors or patterns.
*   **Design Decisions:**
    *   **Variety:** A variety of skins will be available for each fish species, with different colors and patterns.
    *   **Customization:** Players will be able to choose a skin for their fish.
    *   **Visual Appeal:** The skins will be visually appealing and enhance the player's experience.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **Texturing:** Different textures will be used to create the different skins.
    *   **Material Swapping:** Material swapping will be used to apply the different skins to the fish models.
*   **Final Requirements:**
    *   A variety of skins should be available for each fish species.
    *   The skins should be visually appealing.
    *   Players should be able to choose a skin for their fish.
    *   The skin system should be optimized for performance.

## 3. Libraries and Tools
*   **3D Game Engine:** Three.js
*   **3D Modeling Software:** Blender
*   **Text Editor:** VSCode
*   **Version Control:** Git

## 4. Testing
*   **Visual Inspection:** The fish models and animations should be inspected to ensure they meet the design requirements.
*   **Performance Testing:** The game should be tested on different browsers and devices to ensure it runs smoothly.
