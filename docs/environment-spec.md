# Detailed Game Environment Specification: Fish Game

## 1. Introduction
This document provides a detailed specification for the game environment in Fish Game. It outlines the implementation details, library choices, code structure, and testing strategies for creating the 3D reef environment, including predators, caves, and deep areas.

## 2. Core Environment Mechanics

### 2.1. 3D Reef
*   **Description:** The game environment is a 3D representation of the Great Barrier Reef, with varied terrain, coral, and lighting.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **3D Modeling:** Blender will be used to create the 3D models for the reef environment.
    *   **Environment Composition:** The reef will be composed of various coral formations, rocks, and caves.
    *   **Texture Application:** High-resolution textures will be used to create a realistic look.
    *   **Level Design:** The environment will be designed to encourage exploration and discovery.
*   **Code Structure:**
    *   **`ReefEnvironment.js`:** This class will handle the creation and management of the reef environment.
        *   **`constructor(scene)`:** Initializes the reef environment with the Three.js scene.
        *   **`loadModels()`:** Loads the 3D models for the reef environment.
        *   **`createEnvironment()`:** Creates the reef environment by placing the models in the scene.
        *   **`update()`:** Updates the environment (e.g., animations).
*   **Details:**
    *   The reef should be varied and visually appealing.
    *   The environment should encourage exploration and discovery.
    *   The environment should be optimized for performance.

### 2.2. Predators
*   **Description:** Predators are specific to the fish species being played. They will patrol the environment and chase the player if they get too close.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **3D Modeling:** Blender will be used to create the 3D models for the predators.
    *   **AI Implementation:** Basic AI will be implemented for patrol and chase behavior.
    *   **Patrol Behavior:** Predators will patrol specific areas of the environment.
    *   **Chase Behavior:** Predators will chase the player if they get too close.
    *   **Species Specificity:** Different fish species will have different predators.
*   **Code Structure:**
    *   **`Predator.js`:** This class will handle the predator behavior.
        *   **`constructor(scene, fishSpecies)`:** Initializes the predator with the Three.js scene and the fish species it targets.
        *   **`loadModel()`:** Loads the 3D model for the predator.
        *   **`patrol()`:** Implements the patrol behavior.
        *   **`chase(player)`:** Implements the chase behavior.
        *   **`update(deltaTime)`:** Updates the predator's state (e.g., movement, animation).
*   **Details:**
    *   Predators should be visually distinct from the player.
    *   Predators should have realistic patrol and chase behavior.
    *   Different fish species should have different predators.

### 2.3. Caves and Deep Areas
*   **Description:** These areas will be darker and may contain hidden treasures.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Darker Lighting:** The lighting in these areas will be darker to add suspense.
    *   **Hidden Treasures:** Treasure chests will be placed in these areas.
    *   **Environment Variation:** The environment in these areas will be different from the rest of the reef.
*   **Code Structure:**
    *   **`ReefEnvironment.js`:** This class will handle the lighting and environment in these areas.
        *   **`createCave(position)`:** Creates a cave at the specified position.
        *   **`createDeepArea(position)`:** Creates a deep area at the specified position.
        *   **`setLighting(area)`:** Sets the lighting for the specified area.
*   **Details:**
    *   Caves and deep areas should be visually distinct from the rest of the reef.
    *   These areas should be darker to add suspense.
    *   These areas should contain hidden treasures.

## 3. Libraries and Tools
*   **3D Game Engine:** Three.js
*   **3D Modeling Software:** Blender
*   **Text Editor:** VSCode
*   **Version Control:** Git

## 4. Testing
*   **Unit Tests:** Use Jest to test the `ReefEnvironment` and `Predator` classes.
*   **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between the environment, predators, and the player.
*   **Manual Testing:** Play the game and test the environment and predator behavior.

## 5. Code Example (Conceptual)
```javascript
// ReefEnvironment.js
class ReefEnvironment {
  constructor(scene) {
    this.scene = scene;
  }

  loadModels() {
    // Load 3D models for the reef environment
  }

  createEnvironment() {
    // Create the reef environment
  }

  createCave(position) {
    // Create a cave at the specified position
  }

  createDeepArea(position) {
    // Create a deep area at the specified position
  }

  setLighting(area) {
    // Set the lighting for the specified area
  }
}

// Predator.js
class Predator {
  constructor(scene, fishSpecies) {
    this.scene = scene;
    this.fishSpecies = fishSpecies;
  }

  loadModel() {
    // Load the 3D model for the predator
  }

  patrol() {
    // Implement patrol behavior
  }

  chase(player) {
    // Implement chase behavior
  }

  update(deltaTime) {
    // Update the predator's state
  }
}
