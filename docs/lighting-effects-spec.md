# Detailed Lighting and Effects Specification: Fish Game

## 1. Introduction
This document provides a detailed specification for the lighting and visual effects in Fish Game. It outlines the design decisions, implementation details, and final requirements for creating a realistic and immersive underwater environment.

## 2. Core Lighting and Effects

### 2.1. Caustics
*   **Description:** Light patterns on the seabed caused by the refraction of light through water.
*   **Design Decisions:**
    *   **Realism:** The caustics will be designed to simulate the real-world effect of light refracting through water.
    *   **Movement:** The caustics will have a subtle movement effect, to simulate the movement of the water.
    *   **Intensity:** The intensity of the caustics will vary depending on the depth of the water and the angle of the light.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **Shaders:** Shaders will be used to create the caustics effect.
    *   **Texture:** A texture will be used to create the caustics pattern.
    *   **Animation:** The caustics will be animated to simulate the movement of the water.
*   **Final Requirements:**
    *   The caustics should be realistic and visually appealing.
    *   The caustics should have a subtle movement effect.
    *   The intensity of the caustics should vary depending on the depth of the water and the angle of the light.
    *   The caustics should be optimized for performance.

### 2.2. God Rays
*   **Description:** Light rays filtering through the water, creating a sense of depth and atmosphere.
*   **Design Decisions:**
    *   **Realism:** The god rays will be designed to simulate the real-world effect of light filtering through water.
    *   **Intensity:** The intensity of the god rays will vary depending on the depth of the water and the angle of the light.
    *   **Movement:** The god rays will have a subtle movement effect, to simulate the movement of the water.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **Shaders:** Shaders will be used to create the god rays effect.
    *   **Volume:** The god rays will be created using a volumetric effect.
    *   **Animation:** The god rays will be animated to simulate the movement of the water.
*   **Final Requirements:**
    *   The god rays should be realistic and visually appealing.
    *   The god rays should have a subtle movement effect.
    *   The intensity of the god rays should vary depending on the depth of the water and the angle of the light.
    *   The god rays should be optimized for performance.

### 2.3. Ambient Occlusion
*   **Description:** Soft shadows in corners and crevices, to add depth and realism to the scene.
*   **Design Decisions:**
    *   **Realism:** The ambient occlusion will be designed to simulate the real-world effect of light being blocked by objects.
    *   **Intensity:** The intensity of the ambient occlusion will be subtle, to add depth without being too distracting.
    *   **Performance:** The ambient occlusion will be optimized for performance.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **Post-Processing:** Post-processing effects will be used to create the ambient occlusion.
    *   **Shader:** A shader will be used to calculate the ambient occlusion.
*   **Final Requirements:**
    *   The ambient occlusion should be realistic and visually appealing.
    *   The intensity of the ambient occlusion should be subtle.
    *   The ambient occlusion should be optimized for performance.

### 2.4. Particle Effects
*   **Description:** Bubbles and other particle effects, to enhance the underwater feel and create a more immersive experience.
*   **Design Decisions:**
    *   **Variety:** A variety of particle effects will be used, including bubbles, dust, and other underwater particles.
    *   **Realism:** The particle effects will be designed to simulate the real-world effect of underwater particles.
    *   **Performance:** The particle effects will be optimized for performance.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **Particle Systems:** Particle systems will be used to create the particle effects.
    *   **Textures:** Textures will be used to create the particle shapes and colors.
    *   **Animation:** The particles will be animated to simulate the movement of the water.
*   **Final Requirements:**
    *   The particle effects should be realistic and visually appealing.
    *   A variety of particle effects should be used, including bubbles, dust, and other underwater particles.
    *   The particle effects should be optimized for performance.

## 3. Libraries and Tools
*   **3D Game Engine:** Three.js
*   **Text Editor:** VSCode
*   **Version Control:** Git

## 4. Testing
*   **Visual Inspection:** The lighting and effects should be inspected to ensure they meet the design requirements.
*   **Performance Testing:** The game should be tested on different browsers and devices to ensure it runs smoothly.
